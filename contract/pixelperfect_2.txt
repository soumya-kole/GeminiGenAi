RECITALS

WHEREAS, the Parties previously entered into a Software Development Agreement dated September 10, 2024 (the "Original Agreement"); and

WHEREAS, the Parties now desire to amend, add, and delete certain terms of the Original Agreement to reflect evolving project requirements and operational adjustments.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and promises contained herein, the Parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1: AMENDMENT DETAILS

1.1. Amendment to Article 1, Section 1.1 (Services):
Article 1, Section 1.1 of the Original Agreement is hereby amended to clarify the scope of services. The amended Section 1.1 shall read:
"1.1. Services: Developer shall perform data visualization development services for Client as described in Exhibit A (the "Scope of Work"), which is attached hereto and incorporated by reference. The Services shall include, but not be limited to, design, development, testing, deployment, and initial user training of the data visualization dashboard (the "Dashboard")."

1.2. Addition of Article 12: DATA SECURITY AND COMPLIANCE:
A new Article 12 is hereby added to the Original Agreement, immediately following Article 11, to read as follows:
"ARTICLE 12: DATA SECURITY AND COMPLIANCE
12.1. Data Protection: Developer shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Client's data accessed or processed during the performance of Services, in accordance with industry best practices and applicable data protection laws.
12.2. Compliance: Developer shall ensure that all aspects of the Dashboard development and deployment comply with relevant industry standards and regulations, including but not limited to GDPR and CCPA, as applicable to Client's data."

1.3. Deletion of Article 2, Section 2.3 (Expenses):
Article 2, Section 2.3 ("Expenses") of the Original Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety. All references to Client reimbursement for Developer expenses are removed from the Original Agreement. Developer's fees as outlined in Exhibit B are now inclusive of all Developer-incurred expenses.

1.4. Amendment to Exhibit B (Fee Schedule):
Section 1, "Total Project Fee," of Exhibit B of the Original Agreement is hereby amended to reflect the revised scope (including initial user training) and the deletion of the expenses clause. The new total fixed fee for the Services shall be $220,000.00 USD. This increase accounts for the Developer now absorbing all previously reimbursable expenses and the added training component.

ARTICLE 2: EFFECT OF ADDENDUM

2.1. Except as expressly modified, added, or deleted by this Addendum, all other terms and conditions of the Original Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

2.2. This Addendum shall be read and construed as part of the Original Agreement.

ARTICLE 3: GOVERNING LAW

3.1. This Addendum shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of laws principles.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have executed this Addendum as of the Addendum Effective Date.
