| Sales strategy                    | Creatio developed a sales strategy targeted at business and IT buyers. Its multiproduct portfolio and target use cases are well-defined, with the core no-code platform offering to address the business use cases and verticals in which Creatio operates most comfortably, like BFSI and professional service organizations.                                                                                                                                                               |
| Vertical/industry strategy | Creatio's top industry verticals include BFSI, manufacturing and professional services, but it has a natural fit in all industry verticals thanks to the ease of customization and integration, as well as a generic CRM solution built on the Creatio platform. The company is prioritizing the expansion of its capabilities for the key industries it already serves instead of entering new industries.                                                                                           |
| Sales execution/pricing       | Creatio has reported significant sales growth in North America and Europe, with modest expansion in Latin America and Asia/Pacific. Creatio is working to expand beyond its traditional focus on small and midsize enterprises by targeting large companies with marketing and sales messaging about composable architecture, improved customer experience and modular pricing.                                                                                                          |

**Cautions (Creatio)**

| Area                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Market understanding | Creatio's view of the low-code/no-code markets emphasizes hyperautomation and business-led application delivery initiatives. This does not align with the enterprise LCAP market for mission-critical application development that targets IT leaders and software engineering teams.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Marketing strategy  | Creatio markets its product to business users, which has led to limited awareness of its offering among IT buyers, and may hinder the growth associated with platform as a service (PaaS) and more-generic application platform use cases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Business model       | Reliance on business-led application development and democratization of IT makes Creatio primarily focused on business users rather than professional software developers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

**Mendix**
Mendix is a Leader in this Magic Quadrant. Mendix is a subsidiary of Siemens.
Mendix targets a wide range of use cases for enterprises of all sizes, focusing on the manufacturing, financial services and public sector industries. Its key platform features include support for composability and enterprise architecture, embedded tooling and integration in the developer toolchain throughout the software development life cycle and multiexperience application development.
Mendix continues to prioritize innovation in platform and application governance to satisfy the fast-growing demand for mission-critical enterprise application development on LCAPs. It also plans to expand its Al and data architectures.

**Strengths**
*   **Market understanding:** Mendix has anticipated and responded to the current evolution of enterprise developer tooling in the enterprise LCAP market. To fulfill this market demand, it has focused on delivering low-code capabilities designed for developers and IT leaders. Mendix recognizes that IT leaders and enterprise developers are transitioning from traditional enterprise application stacks to managed low-code platforms.
*   **Customer experience:** Mendix has updated its customer success programs to target a wider range of users, including enterprise architects and software engineering leaders. As a result of its improved customer support, a high rate of existing Mendix customers are expanding their license subscriptions by adding new use cases and onboarding more end users on apps developed on the Mendix platform.
*   **Marketing strategy:** Mendix tailors its messaging to three key customer personas: CxOs, software engineering leaders and enterprise architects. Its market segmentation and narrative enable Mendix to effectively target the primary users of enterprise LCAPs. Mendix has unrealized potential in industries such as telecom and healthcare, which have started to accelerate enterprise LCAP adoption and education.

**Cautions**
*   **Marketing execution:** Mendix is not aggressive in promoting its product. Its investment in marketing, developer communities and partner networks is smaller compared to competition of similar size, which could explain its lower market share.
*   **Sales strategy:** Mendix has a relatively small partner network compared to other leading LCAP vendors. This lack of partners may restrict its ability to reach new prospects and support existing customers consistently across all regions, particularly in emerging markets.
*   **Vertical/industry strategy:** Mendix has not gained much momentum outside of its core customer industries (manufacturing, financial services and public sector). It has not shown significant progress in other sectors while it has begun to expand into retail and professional services.

**Microsoft**
Microsoft is a Leader in this Magic Quadrant. Its LCAP offering is a combination of Microsoft Power Apps and Power Pages, Power Automate and Dataverse under the Power Platform product suite.
Microsoft targets a wide range of use cases for enterprises of all sizes across all industries. Its key platform features include Al augmentation for development and end-user experience, a rich technology ecosystem, and developer experience that targets all categories of developer personas.
Microsoft is aiming to significantly reduce the cost of change for the applications and bring down the total cost of ownership. It plans to do this by involving citizen developers and business technologists in application delivery, whereas most vendors prioritize developer productivity and business outcomes. Microsoft is also investing in the user experience (UX) of the applications built with Power Platform by creating a "Generative UX" that fuses its traditional UX with Microsoft Copilot, which should bring intelligence and flexibility to the solutions.

**Strengths**

*   Business model: Microsoft Power Platform gained popularity thanks to its simplified, point-and-click visual development of business capabilities that have mostly been adopted by citizen developers and business technologists. Microsoft has started to address the needs of software engineering teams for developing mission-critical, enterprise-level applications done both in-house and with the help of a global network of systems integrators.
*   Geographic strategy: Microsoft has a sizable number of customers in every region. Its Power Platform has continued to gain more users across the world, as evidenced by its growth rate of 72% year over year. Gartner estimates that Microsoft Power Apps has the largest user base of any enterprise LCAP. Microsoft has also built a robust network of systems integrators and support partners to reach customers on a global scale effectively.
*   Customer experience: Microsoft has heavily funded its Power Accelerator Program to provide large enterprise customers with expert guidance for implementation. Microsoft listened to customer feedback about the lack of support for software engineering teams working jointly with business experts on complex mission-critical application development. It invested in enhancing its governance and developer controls with managed environments, pipeline updates, support for coauthoring and a source code view.

**Cautions**

*   Sales execution/pricing: Microsoft's end-user licensing model makes it difficult for customers to support initiatives that connect multiple tenants and require public access, such as B2B applications, multiexperience development and modernization. Also, additional charges may be required for mission-critical enterprise use cases, such as additional capacity in Dataverse or a separate Power Automate license for workflows triggered outside of Power Apps. The Power Platform Licensing Guide is a complex, 33-page document as of February 2024.
*   Market responsiveness: Microsoft faces the challenge of keeping pace with the demands of its large customer base, which expects the Power Platform to support a wide range of increasingly complex application development use cases. Compared to vendors that serve a more targeted market segment, Microsoft received lower scores for the use cases specific to software engineering teams like complex internal- and external-facing applications.
*   Market understanding: Gartner clients have noticed increased pressure on existing IT governance frameworks, change management processes and tooling as they extend their usage of Microsoft Power Platform. Application development initiatives that span across business and IT often need investment in governance and compliance that extends the capabilities provided by Power Platform.

**Newgen**

Newgen is a Niche Player in this Magic Quadrant. Its LCAP offering is the NewgenONE digital transformation platform.

Newgen primarily targets large enterprises in banking, insurance, the public sector and healthcare. Its key platform features include the Newgen Application Marketplace, which provides a rich selection of application templates and integration connectors for its key customer industries.

Newgen prioritizes business process automation (BPA) use cases for line-of-business back-office applications.

**Strengths**

*   Market understanding: Newgen positions the NewgenONE platform as a better alternative to traditional BPA and modernization tools and platforms. This resonates well with the trend of LCAPs addressing the needs of software engineering teams. Solution and use-case examples support the complex architectures of mission-critical enterprise applications that can be implemented on LCAP.
*   Sales strategy: Newgen continues to target large enterprise customers in the public sector and financial services industry, as 80% of Newgen customers are large enterprises. The company relies on buyer personas that almost equally represent business and IT. This approach helps to increase the chances of successful sales.

- Marketing execution: Newgen builds its marketing around BPA with the promise of support for the entire technology stack. Working with IT leaders and software engineering teams helps Newgen grow the portfolio of mission-critical, complex applications that are delivered with its platform.
Cautions
- Market responsiveness and track record: Newgen's publicly available materials and technical documentation give the impression of a service company that usually describes generic solutions and architectures instead of focusing on the LCAP product's features and showcasing its capabilities.
- Vertical/industry strategy: Newgen has gained a limited number of customers in new verticals outside of the public sector and financial services. It plans to leverage its partner network to expand into verticals such as telecommunications, energy, media and transportation, but has not made much progress.
- Product strategy: Documentation for Newgen's platform capabilities for application build- and runtime components required for mission-critical enterprise application development is limited but available on demand. These limitations in the context of successful sales indicate excessive reliance on development services provided by Newgen or its partners.

Oracle
Oracle is a Challenger in this Magic Quadrant. Its LCAP offering is Oracle APEX Service. It is available as a managed cloud service on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), other managed environments that offer Oracle Database, or a self-managed Oracle Database running on-premises or in the cloud of the client's choosing.

Oracle targets various use cases for organizations of all sizes across all industries. Zero-latency data access and usage-based pricing are among the key APEX platform properties that align with Oracle's promise of performance and scalability.

Oracle's own SaaS application strategy includes APEX as a primary platform for custom development. The company is prioritizing investments in APEX to complement its database product and OCI.

Strengths
- Operations: Oracle is a major dbPaaS, laaS and SaaS vendor running on more than 50 of its own data centers — more than any other LCAP vendor. It targets a global community of 850,000 developers that have access to APEX and offers preloaded data assets/schemas for many industries. Successful expansion of OCI helps to maintain focus on customer success initiatives and interest from the partners in bringing APEX to new use cases and modernization of legacy business capabilities.
- Sales execution/pricing: Oracle is one of the few LCAP vendors that offer usage-based pricing aligned with PaaS products. Most of its competitors offer a SaaS pricing model based on the number of users and applications running on an LCAP.
- Sales strategy: As confirmed by Gartner's client interactions, Oracle is successfully expanding its APEX Service customer base by upselling existing Oracle customers or promoting APEX Service with new sales of Oracle Autonomous Database or OCI. Oracle also leads the effort to convert enterprise developers from traditional application stacks to enterprise LCAP.

Cautions
- Marketing strategy: Gartner analysts occasionally meet clients who want to move from Oracle APEX to another enterprise LCAP because of the missing features or the complexity of their application scenarios. Often, these clients don't understand (or misuse) the APEX platform, which indicates the need for better go-to-market strategy and customer retention initiatives. These should not only focus on the baseline enterprise LCAP features and innovation, but also support core software engineering use cases.
- Business model: Oracle APEX remains strongly linked with the wider Oracle technology and application portfolio, both in terms of implementation and business strategy. This limits the flexibility of technology choices and licensing in complex enterprise environments. It may appear as a strength for some APEX deployments that focus on OCI, Oracle Database or Oracle's business applications, but it's a caution because APEX adoption outside the Oracle ecosystem remains rare.

*   **Product strategy:** The Oracle APEX product portfolio remains modest compared to the leading enterprise LCAPs, with clients mentioning developer experience problems in complex application scenarios. This is especially the case with complex user experiences and workflows, limited integration capabilities, and lack of support for industry-specific, prebuilt components and application templates.

**OutSystems**

OutSystems is a Leader in this Magic Quadrant. Its LCAP offering is the OutSystems platform, with two product versions: OutSystems Developer Cloud (ODC), which offers vendor-managed deployment, and OutSystems 11, designed for customer- managed operations.

OutSystems targets a wide range of use cases for organizations of all sizes across all industries. Its key platform features include an advanced developer toolset for the entire SDLC, integration capabilities and a set of GenAl-powered application development capabilities under the recent Project Morpheus initiative.

OutSystems prioritizes Al-assisted developer experience features and platform support for building Al-powered end-user experiences. It also plans to strengthen its platform's regulatory compliance features to support a broader range of industries.

**Strengths**

*   **Market understanding:** OutSystems has responded to developer demand for GenAl features with Project Morpheus, a GenAl- powered application development capability. It builds a strong sense of developer needs by engaging with communities, organizing events, and offering developer training and certifications.
*   **Vertical/industry strategy:** OutSystems differentiates itself from other enterprise LCAP vendors by extending its customer base beyond financial services and public-sector organizations. OutSystems has acquired new customers across industries with high LCAP potential - such as manufacturing, retail and technology by strengthening its platform's regulatory compliance features. It plans to add support for more compliance protocols to continue its momentum.
*   **Sales strategy:** OutSystems has succeeded in acquiring customers of all sizes. More than half of its customers are small and midsize businesses, but large global enterprises are also present in its customer portfolio. OutSystems has built a strong partner network of GSIs to support customers in every region. Notably, it has established a sizable presence in Asia/Pacific and has become one of Japan's most popular enterprise LCAPs.

**Cautions**

*   **Marketing strategy:** OutSystems broadly targets software engineering teams, aka professional developers. Its platform is not well-known or understood among important buying decision makers like business leaders and sourcing teams. OutSystems could also do more to address the business-specific demands of midsize businesses.
*   **Sales execution/pricing:** OutSystems was one of the few LCAP vendors to increase its platform price in 2023. While OutSystems has expanded its customer base with introductory and volume-based discounts in the past, its future growth will require more sustainable pricing strategies. OutSystems customers have also stated that its pricing model is too complex for mid- and long-term budgeting. Customers seek more straightforward, predictable licensing and pricing models based on organic platform usage.
*   **Product strategy:** Gartner clients continue to report a lack of clarity about the dual-product strategy currently run by OutSystems. Many potential customers and even existing customers express doubts about making long-term investments in OutSystems when they are unsure about the final product strategy, and cannot choose between OutSystems 11 and OutSystems Developer Cloud.

**Pegasystems**

Pegasystems is a Leader in this Magic Quadrant. Its LCAP offering is the Pega Infinity platform.

Pegasystems has one of the biggest LCAP market shares and is well-known for its BPA background. Pegasystems offers industry- and business-specific applications, templates and components for financial services, the public sector, telecom and

8/19

Strengths (Pegasystems)
| Category | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Product strategy | GenAl is the cornerstone of Pega's innovation and product strategy. It has launched Pega GenAl Blueprint for accelerated application delivery and Pega GenAl Autopilot for developer assistance. These GenAl features effectively target enterprise developers and enable them to embed Al decision support into workflows. Pegasystems' product roadmap includes numerous additional Al-powered capabilities. |
| Customer experience | The company boasts a high customer retention rate compared to other vendors in the enterprise LCAP market, and Pega Infinity customers tend to stay with the platform. This strong customer retention indicates high customer satisfaction. |
| Business model | Pegasystems has a significant LCAP market share and global presence. It offers a diverse product portfolio that helps with customer retention and widens the addressable market. The global availability of skills and a network of partners is another advantage of Pegasystems, as highlighted in Gartner customer conversations. |

Cautions
| Category | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Sales execution/pricing | Pegasystems had relatively modest 2023 revenue growth from its LCAP product compared to its competitors in this Magic Quadrant. Also, its usage-based pricing model (price per case) has aggressive limits on capacity and time, which may diminish its utility for pilot projects and production trials. |
| Market understanding | Pegasystems needs to prioritize platform features for the development of a complex and compelling user experience and data virtualization. This will allow it to extend from its home base of BPA use cases and become the platform of choice for external-facing enterprise applications and modernization initiatives. |
| Vertical/industry strategy | Pega Infinity platform client representation is quite segmented by industry verticals and company sizes. The significant progress that has been demonstrated by its competitors will make it challenging for Pegasystems to maintain its dominance in the LCAP market. |

Strengths (Retool)
| Category | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Market understanding | Retool effectively targets enterprise developers and IT leaders in product and sales strategies. Its platform updates align with the needs of these primary users, with features such as public-facing support by Portals, support for multitenancy and tools to embed Al in an application's UX. It plans to expand its efforts to attract more enterprise developers in midsize and large enterprises. |
| Sales strategy | Retool's adoption among nonpaying customers is very high, even compared to more prominent LCAP vendors that offer free licenses. Retool has effectively driven widespread adoption in the developer community. While Retool's |

*   1/13/25, 12:11 PM Gartner Reprint
*   Customer base is primarily small companies, it has gained some large enterprise customers and is actively expanding its efforts to acquire midsize and large enterprise customers.
*   **Sales execution/pricing**: Retool is a fast-growing company, mainly through organic growth based on platform popularity and recognition in developer communities. It also had lower investment in marketing initiatives and partner networks than other LCAP vendors. Retool is one of the only LCAP vendors that has decreased its prices since 2023. Its updated pricing model also supports pricing tiers for different user personas.

**Cautions**

*   **Market responsiveness and track record**: Retool is still catching up with competing enterprise LCAP offerings when it comes to product capabilities. It often relies on code for customizations (JavaScript) which is a deliberate choice for giving developers more control but doesn't align with the enterprise LCAP direction set by some market leaders. Many Retool customers use self-managed deployments, which is a diminishing market.
*   **Geographic strategy**: Retool primarily serves customers in North America, with a smaller presence in Europe and Asia/Pacific. It does not have a widely developed partner network. It has a relatively limited geographic reach and does not offer localized support in every region.
*   **Marketing execution**: To reach more customers, especially large enterprises, Retool needs to significantly expand its sales and marketing investment. It remains a small vendor compared to most others in this Magic Quadrant, so it faces the challenge of competing with larger vendors for visibility in this competitive market.

**Salesforce**

Salesforce is a Challenger in this Magic Quadrant. Its LCAP offering is the Salesforce Platform, which has been rebranded as the Einstein 1 Platform.

Salesforce targets multiple use cases for midsize and large enterprises – mainly in the sales, marketing and customer service categories – across all business verticals. Its key LCAP features are built around extending SaaS products with BPA, Lightning App Builder for UX and data orchestration.

Salesforce is prioritizing the expansion of data-centric use cases and roles, with a focus on Al.

**Strengths**

*   **Customer experience**: Salesforce continues to use its strategic partnership links with AWS, Google and Microsoft to accelerate the adoption of Al features. It keeps open architecture to prevent customer lock-in by supporting "bring your own model," "bring your own large language model" and "bring your own lake" features.
*   **Operations**: Salesforce is a large technology vendor with a significant global presence and strong partner support. It invests in its Hyperforce infrastructure and its Einstein Trust Layer on Hyperforce to provide a reliable and secure environment for Salesforce customers' data and applications running on the Einstein 1 Platform.
*   **Innovation**: Salesforce has delivered innovative Al features and accelerated the adoption of these features via strategic partnerships with AWS, Google and Microsoft. Einstein 1 Studio enables the next generation of code-free application development on Salesforce enabled by GenAl and a foundational metadata platform.

**Cautions**

*   **Market understanding**: Gartner clients often don't associate Salesforce with a low-code application development platform but see it as a rich ecosystem of multiple platforms. In these cases, software engineering teams mostly use the platform's traditional, pro-code capabilities that utilize Apex for complex application development.
*   **Product strategy**: Compared to other vendors, the Salesforce product portfolio does not clearly outline the LCAP product. Salesforce offers low-code capabilities, but with multiple enhancements like Einstein 1, Copilot and Data Cloud, the focus is moving to a highly customizable SaaS offering rather than an LCAP product that targets software engineering teams.

*   Market responsiveness: Salesforce positions the Einstein 1 Platform in the context of building applications for customer experiences within the Salesforce ecosystem, and not as a general-purpose application development platform like some other LCAP vendors.

**SAP**

SAP is a Visionary in this Magic Quadrant. Its LCAP offering is SAP Build, which is part of the broader SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP). SAP BTP connectors represent the data component linking to internal SAP data architectures and external (non-SAP) databases and APIs.

SAP targets various back-office- and line-of-business-specific use cases for medium and large enterprises across all industries. Its key platform features are delivered in the context of the SAP ecosystem. SAP Build is aimed at clients that are extending and enhancing SAP solutions without relying on additional vendors.

SAP prioritizes "fusion development" by unifying its traditional developer stacks and tools with its enterprise LCAP capabilities. While most other application platforms use separate technology stacks and developer tools for different developer personas, SAP's fusion development envisions a single application definition being developed and maintained through different developer experience components (like Build Apps, Build Code, Build Process Automation and Build Work Zone).

**Strengths**

*   Marketing strategy: SAP is promoting the unique concept of fusion development. Instead of converting developers to LCAPS, it combines its traditional developer stack with low-code SAP Build products. This multipronged development strategy resonates with enterprise developers and IT leaders who want the flexibility to use a range of approaches to build custom applications.
*   Product strategy: SAP is unifying and standardizing its application runtimes and developer tools for numerous developer personas and use cases. This new product composition makes it easier for customers to consume SAP Build and establish partnership links. It also provides the SAP Store and SAP Business Accelerator Hub offering prebuilt reusable components that accelerate application delivery.
*   Geographic strategy: SAP is a large technology vendor with a significant customer base in every global region. Its strength as an ERP vendor enables it to effectively offer its enterprise LCAP capabilities to existing customers.

**Cautions**

*   Business model: Like other software vendors with strong SaaS or commercial, off-the-shelf portfolios, SAP considers its LCAP business an extension for its own "main products," be it ERP, CRM or HR platforms that customers need to extend and integrate. This creates a barrier for software engineering leaders and architects looking for a platform of choice for general-purpose or vertical-business-specific application development.
*   Sales execution/pricing: Multiple SAP Build products need to be combined to make a consistent offering that matches our LCAP market definition. In addition, SAP differentiates developer and end-user licenses, with developer licenses being more expensive and applied on top of the Base and Automation package price that enables the app building and workflow functionality within SAP BTР.
*   Product strategy: In conversations with Gartner, clients mentioned the lack of clarity about SAP Build products, how they fit into their existing application architectures or which products to choose for new application delivery. For example, SAP Signavio and SAP Build Process Automation have overlapping features and process automation opportunities. For this reason, SAP requires further architecture harmonization of its complex platform portfolio.

**ServiceNow**

ServiceNow is a Leader in this Magic Quadrant. Its LCAP offering is the ServiceNow App Engine.

ServiceNow targets multiple use cases for large enterprises across all industries, emphasizing process automation. Its crucial platform features include workflow automation, GenAl, and source code management and analysis.

| •             | Customer experience: ServiceNow delivers on customer demand for GenAl and enterprise features for workflow automation. ServiceNow aims to build on its success as an automation technology provider with simple business and technology cases to address the wider scope of application development use cases. |
| •             | Vertical/industry strategy: ServiceNow has built an evenly distributed customer base across all industries. It continues to strengthen its partnership with companies that can help deliver vertical-specific solutions, and is promoting its offering across some industries (including healthcare and life sciences, technology and education sectors) that are not yet prioritized by most LCAP vendors. |
| •             | Marketing strategy: ServiceNow targets IT leaders and top technology decision makers with its LCAP offering. Such targeting matches the market trend of enterprise LCAP usage by software engineering teams for mission-critical enterprise application delivery. BPA remains a core offering in ServiceNow's LCAP stack. This helps it to attract the attention of the business leaders that influence buying decisions. |
| **Cautions** | |
| •             | Marketing execution: Targeting of developer community outreach and software engineering teams — including events and developer-specific marketing — is weaker compared to the other Magic Quadrant Leaders. |
| •             | Market responsiveness: Gartner clients rarely talk about ServiceNow being used for use cases like external-facing applications, mobile app development or complex UX for back-office applications. ServiceNow App Engine remains strongly associated with BPA and integration. |
| •             | Sales strategy: ServiceNow has a free developer trial, but it does not offer a limited free production license. This hinders the piloting of LCAP-based mission-critical application development for organizations new to ServiceNow. |
| **Strengths** | |
| •             | Marketing strategy: Zoho's marketing targets IT leaders and application developers. It highlights a rich SaaS product portfolio and realizes the opportunity to position its LCAP as a central piece of technology that supports flexibility and customization for the entire product suite. |
| •             | Operations: Zoho provides customers with an extended period to transition to new platform versions. This level of flexibility is a differentiator for Zoho compared to other managed-only enterprise LCAPs, and it helps to improve customer experience and retention. |
| •             | Vertical/industry strategy: Zoho delivers generic and composable capabilities that enable success in any business vertical. It uses its sales and partner connections to support business-specific solutions in the industries of its choice, such as |
