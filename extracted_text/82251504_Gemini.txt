Acceptance/Response: What is the retailers response to Lorillard's Excel
Merchandising plan?
Chains: This program has been successful to date with chains where our "Flex
Payment" was not in place. The chains where we were using the "Flex Payment"
system we have not been as successful. The P.O.S. requirements of the P-1 Plan
with Oil Companies is difficult to obtain.
Independents:
Additional P.V. merchandising is being secured quickly.
Additional monies have assisted Region 17 in fighting PM Exclusives and PM/RJR
co-existence situations.
Hardware Evaluation/Effectiveness; Comment on the assembly of displays and
application of shields:
The displays are easily assembled and durable. Some questions have been raised

As well as the ability to place this on the Back Bar if the settlement goes through.
